      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the bug bounty industry, companies/programs reward hackers with bounties for their contribution, most of the time money and swag from time to time.
But what about platforms?
How platforms thank their hackers?
Unfortunately events are not a standard and only a few selected hackers can participate.
What about something more popular, something fair, something that all hunters could enjoy, even the beginners, even the casuals?
All platforms have a scoring system so what if you could transform this reputation/score to something more concrete?
This is THE SWAG STORE.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
