      <description>&lt;p&gt;We all know the famous quote &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Think out of the box&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;.
Technical knowledge is important but creativity is also.
In bug bounty, to get nice rewards, sometimes you don&amp;rsquo;t need to be a crazy coder or great network engineer, you simply need to try what other didn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, Slack get in trouble because many developers leave their credentials in their public repository.
Last year Uber had to deal with a major security issue: database keys were stored in GitHub (this leads to a sweet bounty for the finder).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found an interesting project, on GitHub itself, to parse the search engine results: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/melvinsh/vcsmap&#34;&gt;vcsmap from Melvinsh&lt;/a&gt;.
Unfortunately the scrapper seems to have trouble with search that required authentication.
Since I don&amp;rsquo;t understand Ruby, I wrote my own tool with PHP.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
