      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of resources availableÂ about hacking and security, here are my favorites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some blogs I frequently visit from bounty hunters themself.
They explain their findings, why it occurs, how they were able to exploit and sometimes how much they win.
I visit them once a week and I also follow their writer on Twitter to not miss the bugs they don&amp;rsquo;t review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion the best way to learn hacking and security is to read public disclosure.
It&amp;rsquo;s a great resources of tips and tools to use to make your life easier.
Some of my favorites issues, the ones I like to read again and again to understand the vulnerability and try to discern the state of mind of the hacker who found it.
It&amp;rsquo;s also a good way to improve your report skill and see the way hackers communicates with security teams to keep good feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Time I learn a new kind of issue, I try to reproduce it on on my local lab, then I try it on security programs I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on.
Sometime it works, sometimes not but bug bounty is also about patience. Happy reading !&lt;/p&gt;</description>
