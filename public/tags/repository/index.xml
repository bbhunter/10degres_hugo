      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a real story or not, that occured in mid 2017 or not, about a private program or not, on Hackerone or not, believe me or not, but it changed my life.
I would like to thanks all the people from this company I talked with.
They were very nice with me, very fast to fix the bugs and I always got the rewards in less than 7 days, frequently the day of the report, even for the smallest bugs.
Thanks to them, I wish we could find more program like this one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
