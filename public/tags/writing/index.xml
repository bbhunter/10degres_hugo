      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the first thing I learned when I started security, is that the report is just as important as the pentest itself.
Some bug bounty platforms give reputation points according the quality.
While there is no official rules to write a good report, there are some good practices to know and some bad ones to avoid.
Mines are probably not the best but I never had any problem with any company, it&amp;rsquo;s also pretty rare that the secteam asks for more informations since I try to detail as much as I can in the initial report.
Let me give you some tips and the global pattern of my templates.
If you like it, use it, if not, then create your own :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
