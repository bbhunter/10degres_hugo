      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a user I would say that I don&amp;rsquo;t care about all these Flash stuff that try to catch my eyes, most of the time I have a plugin to disable them.
As a developper, it reminds me the (not so good) old time when the marketing peoples always wanted to add &amp;ldquo;movement&amp;rdquo; in the website, yeah it looks so kool!
As a hacker, well&amp;hellip; I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how nice it could be, but I recently learned how to find issue in there and it&amp;rsquo;s funny as hell.
I was close to the success as I quickly found 3 XSS, but unfortunately all my reports were marked as duplicate :/&lt;/p&gt;</description>
