After many years of web development, I finally decided to follow my dream: perform in the security industry.
In october 2015, after 3 months of hard work, I successfully passed the famous Offensive Security Certified Professional exam.

Since, Bug Bounty is my daily.  
As a hunter, I mainly work on <a href="https://hackerone.com/glc" target="_blank">HackerOne</a>, the american leader in the field.
As an active member of the community, I created many tools to automate the basics.

In order to promote the Bug Bounty industry, I also help companies in this adventure.
Whether for a first step or to improve the relationship with hackers, I can intervene on any part of a program.
