With more than 6 years of experience, I had the opportunity to study several aspects of this industry:

- As a full time bug hunter, I am pretty familiar with their expectations:
What they look for, what are their problems, what make them more involved...

- As a consultant, I work with platforms to solve the common problems in a relationship with hackers and handle the daily.
Support the customers, manage the reports, keep hackers on the right track...

- As a consultant, I help companies to manage their program.
How to choose a scope, how to create a reward policy, what are SLAs...

- As this list shows, I spent time to study [the main platforms](https://github.com/gwen001/BB-datas) available on the current market.
Depending of some criterias (size, country, law...) some of them probably fit better to your business.

In a nutshell my goal is to help all actors in the bug bounty industry to be successful and develop the programs on the long term.

# Security audit

Specialized in LAMP models, I perform security audits on websites using those technologies, on site or remotely.
The time required mainly depends on the size of the perimeter of the test, basically how many pages/scripts/functionalities are concerned.

After the audit you will get a report resuming the checks performed and the issues found.
Because of my developer background, I am able to understand how to fix them and potentially help in this task.
